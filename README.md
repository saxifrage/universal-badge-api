# universal-badge-api

##An ideal Universal Open Education Badges API:

- is centralized
- is open source
- is cloud-based
- allows an an Organizer/Issuer to submit badges that require an endorsement and all associated badge metadata (which include competency metrics and a high-level curriculum)
- allows any learning platform that uses open education badges to leverage it for any badge interactions. Badges can still be saved on that relative learning platform but the Single Source of Truth (SSoT) is always with this centralized API
- allows learner to choose the level of permission they grant to the learning platform (provides good scoping... can publish badges to LinkedIn using assertion, for example)

###Actionables
1. Mockup UX of badge creation/endpoints (include competency/associated scale "tags") 
2. Share idea with folks at Badgr
3. Share idea with folks at Badge Alliance
4. Implement
