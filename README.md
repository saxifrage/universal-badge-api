# universal-badge-api

##Ideal badge API to hold/archive learner data:
- is open source
- 100% centralized (using the cloud)
- "one stop shop" for all consuming education platforms to issue/retrieve badges over a learner's lifetime
- authentication/authorization for the platform and users themselves should be painless
- empowers users to exhibit certain badges publically, at their will (such as a "Business Finance" badge on LinkedIn)
- empowers users to pull Competency Benchmark Indicator data for their resume/website
- (flexibly) leverages an open badge standard
- badges contains well-defined and weighted curated competencies (for Competency Benchmark Indicator data) by respected organizations/experts
- badges need to exhibit evidence that confirms learner took course
- badges need endorsements from respected organizations/experts (critically important)
- badges need to be approved by a board of volunteers (not just added arbitrarily)
- organizations/instructors need to be one-time-approved by a board of volunteers

##Existing solution, http://info.badgr.io/
- is decentralized
- is relatively mature
- focuses on verifying badges via endorsements
- "lifetime of learning" data-focus (includes import tool for at least Mozilla)
- not sure what "unlock new opportunities and collaborations" means
- earner API is still in the works, it seems
- badges are not *solely* for education
- conforms to the Mozilla open badge standard
- is not just an API, it also contains an iOS/Android/Web client app
- doesn't seem to concern itself with any formal boards/evidence/additional metadata/etc

###Actionables
1. Mockup UX of badge creation/endpoints (include competency/associated scale "tags") 
2. Talk to folks at Badgr
3. Continue thinking about an ideal badge API
4. Implement
