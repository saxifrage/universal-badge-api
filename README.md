# universal-badge-api

##An ideal Universal Open Education Badges API:

- is centralized
- is open source
- is cloud-based
- is limited to education badges
- allows any learning platform that uses open education badges to permit its users to easily pull in badges (single entity across decentralized systems)
- allows learners to easily embed their badges on various platform (LinkedIn, for example)

##Eventually this API should (Post MVP):

- allow for badge creation
- allow for a degree of quality control (crowd sourcing?)
- only accept badges that have endorsements (talk to Badge Alliance about this)

###Actionables

4. Fork Badgr.io's Earner API and use it to build from (?)
5. Build up backlog
